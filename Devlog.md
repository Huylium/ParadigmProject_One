# ParadigmProject_One
Project description(from pdf)  <<
In this project you will create a prefix-notation expression calculator. The calculator will prompt
the user for an expression in prefix notation and calculate the result of the inputted expression.
A history will be kept so that previous results can be used in expressions. You are expected to
handle possible errors in the user’s input. Do not forget to follow the “Git/Project Instructions”.
